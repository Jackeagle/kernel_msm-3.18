      Number of cells required to uniquely identify the thermal sensors. Since
      we have multiple sensors this is set to 1

      From common IIO binding. Used to pipe PMIC ADC channel to thermal monitor

  io-channel-names:
    description:
      From common IIO binding. Names each of IIO channels. The name should
      be equal to the sensor's subnode name.

        description:
          Channel calibration type.
          If this property is specified VADC will use the VDD reference
          (1.875V) and GND for channel calibration. If property is not found,
          channel will be calibrated with 0V and 1.25V reference channels,
          also known as absolute calibration.

        description: Used for scaling the channel input signal before the signal is fed to VADC. See qcom,spi-vadc specification for the list of possible values.
